## Getting Started

This project is written in Python 3, so it works in all major OSes.
Keep in mind to use pip or pip3 depending on your settings.

Clone this repo

Run `pip install maskrcnn-modanet --user`

Or go to the repo you just cloned on the terminal and run `pip install . -e --user`

Now that you've installed it, run `maskrcnn-modanet datasets download the/folder/you/want/to/put/data/in`

It will take a while, about 40GB to download!

Then you can explore its features and commands by running `maskrcnn-modanet`
